Node.js is most popular for it’s asynchronous event-driven, non-blocking I/O processing.
It gets most of this concurrency and asynchronism from Javascript’s single-threaded event loop model.

MULTITHREADED
Every time the server receives a request from the client, it picks a thread from the pool and assigns it to the client to process request.
Inside these threads, the processing is SEQUENTIAL and synchronous in nature [ for blocking IO calls ]
dead-locking, wherein multiple threads are blocked forever in the process of waiting for each other to free up resources.
